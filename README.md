# Product Management APP
AngularJS and Laravel (API) product-management application with Ionic Mobile APP

You can see the progress of the application here (The latest build will be live): [http://therealcarlos.com/extra/product-manager/#/](http://therealcarlos.com/extra/product-manager/#/)

This application was shows off the power of Angular and Laravel together. Although in the making I hope to make a full featured inventory management application with a multi user database. 

In this application I use the power of AngularJS for the Front End, and Laravel for the backend as a REST API Service. 

Built in as well is an Android Mobile App written in Ionic. The app (not done), will do the same thing as the Angular Web application. 

Inorder to use the app, please have [Inonic](http://ionicframework.com/ "Ionic") installed. 

Then 'cd' into the mobile_app directory and run 'ionic serve'. 

This will fireup a NodeJS server with the ionic application. 


Things To Do:
- Finish the Android App to be the same as the web app
- Add a way to see the total of cost of all items in inventory
- Be able to raise and lower stock inventory without hitting 'edit'
- Have sortable columns
